    <p>This tool allows you to locate and evaluate projects for porting. It displays 
      and color codes relevant information, allowing you to quickly estimate how much 
      effort a port might take. You can also setup a basic Jenkins job for the project
      with one click or create a batch file to build and test multiple projects.</p>

  <div id="batchTabHeader" rv-show="globalState.isBatchTabActive">
    <p>Import - Allows you to select a local batch file and upload it to the server
      where the tool is running.</p>
    <p>List/Select - List and take action on batch files located on the server and 
      the registered shared location.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Details - examine and modify the content of a batch file</li>
      <li>Build server - select the build server(s) to run a batch job.  Each
          server selected will run the entire batch job</li>
      <li>Build + Test - submit a batch job on the selected build server(s)</li>
      <li>Archive - copy the batch file to a shared location (configured by the Settings menu),
          so that other autoport installations may use it</li>
      <li>Remove - erase a batch file from the local or archived location</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may look at the test history of a project or batch file and generate
      comparisons across platforms and project versions. Like batch files, test 
      results are stored locally on the server, until you archive them to the
      shared location.  Test results are archived using the Reports tab.</p>
    <p>Select the type of report that you would like generated.</p>
